# Data science learning projects

This repo contains solutions to different test or practice projects. At this moment there are three projects from datacamp.com
* [Dr. Semmelweis and the discovery of handwashing](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/20)
* [Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184)
* [Exploring the Bitcoin cryptocurrency market](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/82)

I will add more as I work through them.
